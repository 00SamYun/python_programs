### Simple Command Line Hangman

This is a traditional 1 player hangman game.

It keeps track of each player's points which determines the type of hints they can get. 

This, along with other user information is stored in an SQL Database.

The game is meant to be played in the command line but can be played in an interactive shell as well.

Run the `main.py` file to play the game!
